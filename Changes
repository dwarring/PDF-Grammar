    Release 0.04
    - Added $*OBJ-NUM and $*GEN-NUM dynamic variables, plus minor tweaks
      to string rule.

      Thi is to aid PDF decryption in PDF-Tools, which needs to know
      the parent object and generation numbers of strings and streams.

      Also added t/pdf-decrypt.t which demonstrates dummy decryption with
      and actions subclass with overrides 'string' and 'stream' rules.

    Release 0.03
    - Reworked 'stream' AST to return :encoded stream content. Rather
      than :start and :end positions of the stream.

      This was orginally intended as a optimisation. In practice the reader
      only uses this rule in :repair mode, in which case it always extracts
      the stream data, nullifying this optismisation

    - tweaked ind-obj-nibble rule to use .codes rather than .chars to compute
      offset of stream start - safer in a post-NFG world. Latin encoding now
      has "\n\r" as a combining newline character.
