    Release 0.0.7
    - Optimized stream token

    Release 0.0.6
    - Make META.info version consistent with PDF::Grammar:ver<...>
    - Declare "perl6" : "6" in META.info
    - new <xref-first> rule. A variation of <xref> that assumes we've
      hopped over the first few bytes. Needed by PDF::Reader to (gulp)
      handle the /T offset entry in linerization dictionary.
    - minor optimisations to <ws> and <name> rules
    - replaced a couple of regex with rules/tokens
    - <xref-section> - allow zero <xref-entry>'s
      As observed in some realy-world PDF's

    Release 0.0.5
    - Replaced JSON::Tiny with JSON::Fast
    - Removed PDF::Grammar::Stream
    - Slightly relax trailer parse. Don't require a \n before trailer dictionary
    - Fixed whitespace handling in <PDF::Grammar::Doc::ind-obj-nibble> rule

    Release 0.0.4
    - Added `AST Reference` section to README.
    - Renamed a couple of token tags for consistency:
         -- object-first-num => obj-first-num
         -- object-count => obj-count

    Release 0.0.3
    - Reworked 'stream' AST to return :encoded stream content. Rather
      than :start and :end positions of the stream.

      This was originally intended as a optimization. In practice the reader
      only uses this rule in :repair mode, in which case it always extracts
      the stream data anyway.

    - tweaked ind-obj-nibble rule to use .codes rather than .chars to compute
      offset of stream start - safer in a post-NFG world. Latin encoding now
      has "\n\r" as a combining newline character.

    Release 0.0.2
    - General fixes for the 2015 Rakudo GLR

    Release 0.0.1
    - Initial development
